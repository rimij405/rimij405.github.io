# Data Science 001 - Journey into Python #

I am practicing being concise. I want to simultaneously explore the field of data science and document my journey.

As part of enrollment in a seminar covering humanitarian free (libre) and open software (HFOSS), I was introduced to Python for the sake of creating an educational application for the Sugar desktop environment. Sugar is not the focus of this post; instead, I want to focus more on *learning* Python. 

## The Past Informs the Present ##

I was born in December of 1997. I was first introduced to Python when I was seven years old. My father sat me down in front of an old computer tower that had a floppy disk drive in it - I don't remember the model name - and put me in front of an old IDE. I don't remember the name of that, either.

The syntax didn't stick, but, the concepts remained. I would go on to enroll at the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2015 and pursue my undegraduate degree in Game Design & Development.

## Data Science ##

Recently, I became enamoured with the idea of actually using my knowledge of computer science to explore datasets in a meaningful way. Many years ago, while enrolled in [high school](https://www.bxscience.edu/), I was privileged to be in a school that was fell-funded and held encouraging programs for those interested in the sciences. At the time, I was still learning the basics of Java and C#, so data never gripped me as much as the game development industry did.

I went on to watch my peers do interesting things with data - I recall one group mapped geography to crime data and won a competition for their findings. My memory fails me, and, I am unsure of the specific name of that competition - but the essence of what inspired me still influences me to pursue this field in my leisure time.

## Why Python? ##

`Python` is only one option when dealing with data analysis and visualization. There are libraries for data visualization in `JavaScript`, such as D3.js and `R` is a free software environment created for statistical computing and graphics.

I simply chose Python since I was already using it for Sugar development and felt that the barrier to entry would be lower.

## Learning Python ##

So that's the goal: learn python for the sake of getting better with Data Science and chronicle the journey along the way.
