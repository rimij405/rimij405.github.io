My name is Ian Effendi, an interactive software developer from The Bronx, New York. I am currently finishing up my degree in Game Design and Development at the [School for Interactive Games and Media](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/), a college at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).

## About this Website ##

I have a general enthusiasm when it comes to software development, but, I have a lifelong, visceral infatuation with learning. I love to learn; the biggest challenge is scheduling enough time in my day to keep up with all of the subjects that hold my interest.

And trust me, there are a **lot** of them.

There is a lot of good information available on the internet, much of it free to access for the general user. I hope to contribute to that pool of knowledge, whenever and however I can.

## Developer Philosophy ##

Much of my work is built upon the philosophy of [open source culture](https://opensource.com/open-source-way): it goes beyond software development, alone. As a developer of color, it is imperative that the work I do remains free to access for those looking for representation within any technology industry.

### Understandable, Accountable, Trusted ###

I am by no means the only developer who believes that [technology is inherently political](https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2018/05/18/the-politics-of-code-an-exploration-of-technological-activism/). There are collectives, such as [Dark Inquiry](https://thenewinquiry.com/dark-inquiry/), that serve to challenge and expose, "the anti-human logic of dominant technological power, and demonstrate the possibilities beyond it."

In 1793, the following statement appeared in a volume issued by the [French National Convention](https://books.google.com/books?id=D55aAAAAcAAJ&q=ins%C3%A9parable#v=snippet&q=ins%C3%A9parable&f=false):

> Ils doivent envisager qu’une grande responsabilité est la suite inséparable d’un grand pouvoir.
> English translation: They must consider that great responsibility follows inseparably from great power.

What happens when a [social media platform serving billions of people has trouble distinguishing between real and fake news](https://www.fastcompany.com/3066630/here-is-facebooks-first-serious-attempt-to-fight-fake-news)? Why are [accessibility options](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/spider-man-accessibility-options-feature/) in video games [unusually](https://www.polygon.com/features/2014/8/6/5886035/disabled-gamers-accessibility) [sparce](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-05-27-accessibility-in-gaming-should-be-the-rule-not-the-exception)?

In an article making the case that [Software Is Politics](https://www.fastcompany.com/3066631/software-is-politics), Richard Pope writes, "that power is mutable," changing over time - and, "that politics is about the distribution of power in society." You can read more about Pope's case for designing accountable software [here](https://blog.memespring.co.uk/2016/11/23/oscon-2016/).

I find myself revisiting Pope's interpretation of conscious software development:

> Software needs to be understandable, accountable, trusted, *and* easy to use.

This is what guides my work, and, it's important to talk about!
